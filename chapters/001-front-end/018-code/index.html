      There is a huge trend in 2019 for almost every library, framework and
      larger project to switch to TypeScript. If you haven't heard about
      TypeScript or Flow they are supersets of JavaScript which also provide
      type systems
    </p>
    <p>I recommend TypeScript for applications developed by Teams</p>
    <p>
      The Types really help to reduce bugs. They also helpful by describing the
      interface for your components and thanks to great editor support they will
      give you auto completion and instant feedback on errors.

  <h4>ESlint</h4>
  <img src="img/eslint-logo.png" />
  <aside class="notes">
    A static code analysis that checks your code for possible errors or checks
    against code quality guidelines. It can be dangerous. I've seen project in
    which rules have been blindly activated before checking what they'll do. And
    that lead to confusion about React and worse code in general. My advice:
    Keep ESLint in its default settings for create-react-app.

  <aside class="notes">
    My favorite tool to emerge out of the last years. It's an highly opinionated
    code formatter. It's mandatory for all our projects. We use a git commit
    hook to automatically format the code on commit. So code of those who do not
    have on-save-actions is also formatted. No more merge conflicts because of
    white-space changes.
