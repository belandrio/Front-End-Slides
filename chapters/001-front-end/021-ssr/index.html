      React is primarily run on the client at run time. Static or server
      rendered pages are still faster but single page applications are perfectly
      fine, unless... you depend on your page being indexable by search engine
      bots. And those may not be able to run your javascript code before
      indexing the page. Apparently the GoogleBot is able to run the JavaScript
      code first but you'll never know how much of it and what about the others?

      So SSR to the rescue

      I recommend using NextJS. I didn't have time to get hands-on experience
      with Next, but I'm really eager to try it. It will be my next project, but
      I wanted to finish the slides first.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I've closely followed the development and the docs of next for over a
      year now and it's tagline is the web application framework for react maybe
      true not an overstatement. It seems like create react app on steroids.
    </p>
    <p>
      Definitely have a look at it and see if you have use for it.
