    <h3>The number of JS frameworks available is high and that number continues to grow.</h3>
    <aside class="notes">
        The most popular JavaScript frameworks available present some common capabilities. In particular, they:
        - can keep state and view synchronized
        - offer routing functionality
        - let developers build, reuse, and maintain user interface components that are efficient and fast to respond to
        user interaction.

            REACT
            - React is quick to learn and use. It’s JavaScript with a small API.
            - Code components are stable and reusable. They’re a breeze to create and maintain using the API’s
            declarative syntax.
            - A big company and a strong community support React.
            - The library is stack agnostic, can also render on the server using Node.js, and on mobile apps with React
            Native.
        </p>
        <p>
            ANGULAR
            - Cross-platform – progressive web apps, native mobile apps, and desktop
            - Offers speed and performance
            - Has great features like filters, two-way data binding, directives, and more
            - Makes available awesome tooling for faster development
            - Has full support from Google and a strong community of developers behind it.
        </p>
        <p>
            VUE
            - Developer-friendly. If you know the languages of the web (HTML, CSS and JavaScript), the Vue docs are all
            you need to start building right away.
            - You can integrate it within a project progressively. It easily scales from a library to a full-fledged
            framework.
            - Small and comes with a super-fast virtual DOM.
            - Has an amazing community behind it, which makes it a stable framework to adopt.
